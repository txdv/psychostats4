__DATA__

=head1 NAME

PsychoStats - Comprehensive Statistics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

stats.pl [options]

stats.pl -daily [daily options]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-config> <filename>

Specifies an alternate filename to load the required database settings 
for PsychoStats. By default the stats.cfg file is loaded.

=item B<-noconfig>

Disables the loading of any database config file. When -noconfig is used it
is assumed that the actual database connection settings are specified using 
the -db* command line options explained below.

=item B<-daily> [all,maxdays,decay,players,clans,ranks,awards]

The daily process performs several intensive stats updates that can not be
done in 'real-time'. This includes calculating player ranks, removing stale
clans, applying skill decay to players and removing old stats that are older
than the current maxdays setting.

=item B<-dbtype> [mysql]

The database engine type to use. 'mysql' is the default.
'mysql' is actually the only working option.

=item B<-dbhost>

The hostname or IP address of the database to connect to. 
'localhost' is the default.

=item B<-dbport>

The port to connect to. Defaults to the standard port of the 
database type specified. Ex: 3306 for mysql.

=item B<-dbname>

Name of the database to use. Defaults to 'psychostats'. 
This is not to be confused with the host of the database server. 
The 'name' is a database within the server where the tables are stored.

=item B<-dbuser>

The username to connect to the database server. Defaults to NULL.

=item B<-dbpass>

The password to connect to the database server. Defaults to NULL.

=item B<-dbtblprefix>

The table prefix string to use for all tables within the PsychoStats
database. Defaults to 'ps_'. 

=item B<-debug> [1,2,3,4,5]

Enables Debug output. If no numberic value is given it defaults to 1. The 
higher the value the more debug output shown. 5 will show all SQL commands
queried and is not normally recommended.

=item B<-debugfile> <filename>

All debug output is written to a debug.txt file in the current directory.
If a filename is specified its name is used instead. Using this implies
"-debug 1" if no debug was specified.

=item B<-gametype> <type>

Processes logs using the specified GAME type. IE: halflife, cod. Using this
option has a side effect of actually changing the value in your database
configuration permanently. Most users will not have to use this. The update
will fail if an unknown gametype is specified. See also: B<-modtype>

=item B<-help>

If you do not know what this does by now, go seek help, YOU NEED IT!

=item B<-logsource> <path>

Process the log source given. Will ignore all log sources currently
configured in the database. This does not add the logsource to your 
configuration permanently.

=item B<-maxlines> <number>

Specifies the maximum number of log lines to process before exiting. Normally
you never need this but on some systems that have system resource restraints
using this can help limit resource usage. By default all available lines will
be processed.

=item B<-maxlogs> <number>

Specifies the maximum number of logs to process before exiting, see -maxlines
for more information.

=item B<-modtype> <type>

Processes logs using the specified MOD type. IE: cstrike, dod. Using this
option has a side effect of actually changing the value in your database
configuration permanently. Most users will not have to use this. The update
will fail if an unknown modtype is specified. See also: B<-gametype>

=item B<-nodaily>

Skips all daily processing procedures after logs are processed.

=item B<-passive, -pasv>

Enables PASSIVE mode for FTP logsources. This provides a quick way to toggle
passive mode on or off w/o having to edit the configuration first. Once you
figure out which method works you can edit the config to make it permanent.

=item B<-reset> [all,players,clans,weapons]

Resets all stats in your database. If 'players', 'clans' or 'weapons; is 
specified then the profiles for each will also be reset. 
By default profiles and weapons are saved.

B<*** IMPORTANT ***> This can NOT be undone! Use at your own risk.

=item B<-scanclantags> [all]

Rescans all players currently not associated with a clan for matching clantags.
Run this if you just configured a new clantag. Otherwise players that match will
not actually assoicate with the new clantag until they reconnect to the server.

If "all" is specified then ALL PLAYERS will be scanned regardless if they are 
already in a clan. This is usefull if player names have changed and they need 
to be matched against a new clan instead of their original clan.
NOTE: this will cause all current clans to be rescanned. Your clans listing will 
be emptied and repopulated.

This forces a "-daily clans" update.

=item B<-unknown>

Temporarily enables the errlog.report_unknown option from the config. This does
not update the database and only lasts for the current process.

=item B<-verbose>

Enable stats progress output. As stats are updated the progress is displayed.
If running under Windows verbose defaults to ON. Use -quiet to turn it off.

=item B<-V>, B<-version>

Display software version

=item B<-quiet>

Overrides the verbose option and disables it if verbose was already enabled.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<PsychoStats> is awesome!
