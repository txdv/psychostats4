= PsychoStats Version 3.0 Installation = 

For more detailed installation instructions please view the online
documentation at the following URL:
http://www.psychostats.com/wiki/PsychoStats_Installation

For those that are too impatient follow the quick step guide below.

== Quick Note ==

All files in this archive except the 'stats' directory all
belong TOGETHER. You can put these files ANYWHERE you want. If 
you want to make a new directory for them somewhere, fine. Just make
sure the directory structure remains the same as outlined above. IE:
if you move stats.pl somewhere then the 'lib' directory should move
with it.

The only suggestion I can make is that the stats.pl and lib directory
SHOULD NEVER BE located inside your website directory tree. If you put 
it somewhere where the webserver can access it then any user on the 
Internet would be able to read your stats.cfg file and see your database
settings. You've been warned.

== QUICK WINDOWS INSTALLATION ==

I encourage Windows users to view the online documentation as it has
very detailed steps on what to do for installation.

1) You've already unzipped the archive. So you have a directory 
structure that looks like this:

* \lib
* \stats
* stats.pl
* stats.cfg
* psychostats.bat
* daily.bat
* rescanclans.bat
(and some other assorted files)

2) Copy the 'stats' directory to your website. If your website is 
on the same machine then just drag and drop the directory inside
your website directory. If your website is remote you'll want to 
upload the 'stats' directory to the remote server.

3) Browse to the stats installation wizard with your browser:
	http://localhost/stats/install/index.php
Be sure to replace 'localhost' with the actual domain name of your
website. And then just follow the instructions.

4) Edit the stats.cfg in this directory with the proper database 
settings so PsychoStats can connect to your database. 

5) Double click on 'psychostats.bat' to update your stats (or you
can also double click on 'stats.pl').

== QUICK LINUX INSTALLATION ==

1) You've already unzipped the archive. So you have a directory 
structure that looks the same as the directory listing in the 
Windows instructions above.

2) Copy the 'stats' directory to your website. The rest of the archive 
should remain where it is. Usually within your home directory. There is
no need to move it anywhere. However, make sure its NOT within your 
WWW or public_html directory tree. Otherwise remote users would be able 
to view your stats.cfg and gain access to your database. 

	mkdir -p /path/to/website/stats
	cp -rf stats /path/to/website/stats

3) Browse to the stats installation wizard with your browser:
	http://yoursite.com/stats/install/index.php
Be sure to replace 'yoursite.com' with the actual domain name of your
website. And then just follow the instructions.

4) Edit the stats.cfg in this directory with the proper database 
settings so PsychoStats can connect to your database. 

5) All Done! Now you just need to run the stats.pl to update your stats.
If you have shell access on your server then just run:
	./stats.pl -v
If you do not have shell access, and are limited to only running programs
with 'cron' updates then you'll want to add a cron entry to run the stats.pl
on a daily basis (like every hour or so).
