	Language mapping for 'en_US' auto-generated from pslang.pl.

	To start a new language set, copy this file to a new name using the locale or a simple name 
	representing the language (ie: chinese) as its name. A locale string is normally a 2 character
	code for the language, ie: en for english, fr for french, etc... Followed by an underscore (_) 
	then a 2 character country code for the language, ie: US, DE, PT, etc...
	For example, for french you might use "fr_FR", or for spanish use "es_US".

	Use the pslang.pl script included with PsychoStats to auto-generate a new language file like this.
