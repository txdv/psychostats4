/**
 * =============================================================================
 * SourceMod PsychoStats Plugin
 * Implements support for PsychoStats and enhances game logging to provide more
 * statistics.
 *
 * This plugin will 'fix' the game logging so the first map to run on
 * server restart will log properly (HLDS doesn't log the first map). This
 * will prevent any 'unknown' maps from appearing in your player stats.
