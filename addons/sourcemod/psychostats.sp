/**
 * =============================================================================
 * SourceMod PsychoStats Plugin
 * Implements support for PsychoStats and enhances game logging to provide more
 * statistics. 
 *
 * This plugin will add "Spatial" stats to mods (just like TF). This allows
 * Heatmaps and trajectories to be created and viewed in the player stats.
 * This plugin will also 'fix' the game logging so the first map to run on 
 * server restart will log properly (HLDS doesn't log the first map). This
 * will prevent any 'unknown' maps from appearing in your player stats.
