PsychoStats Version 3.0 Installation
------------------------------------
See the online documentation for detailed information
http://www.psychostats.com/wiki/PsychoStats_Installation

The instructions below are for users running Linux. If you 
are running Windows please see the documentation linked above. The 
documentation also has more detailed information for Linux.

1) Uncompress the PsychoStats archive (which you've already done)

	This will create a new directory named "psychostats<version>".
	Where <version> is the current version of the software.

2) Copy the contents of the 'web' sub directory to your website. 
The rest of the archive directory should remain where it is. There is
no need to move it anywhere. However, make sure its NOT within your 
WWW or public_html directory tree. Otherwise remote users would be able 
to view your stats.cfg and gain access to your database. 

	mkdir -p /path/to/website/stats
	cp -r web/* /path/to/website/stats

3) Run install.php from your stats website. Browse to your stats page:

	http://yoursite.com/stats/install/index.php

4) Edit stats.cfg with your DB settings

5) All done! run the stats.pl to start updating your stats.
